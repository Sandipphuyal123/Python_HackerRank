# 003 - Arithmetic Operators
## Task

Read two integers from STDIN and print three lines where:

1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

#### Input Format
The first line contains the first integer, `a` . The second line contains the second integer,`b` .

#### Constraints
* 1 <= a <= 10<sup>10</sup>

* 1 <= b <= 10<sup>10</sup>

#### Output Format
Print the three lines as explained above.

```
Sample Inputs
3
2
```

```
Sample Output
5
1
6
```

#### Explanation

3 + 2 => 5
3 - 2 => 1
3 * 2 => 6


#### Given Code

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
```

## Solution 

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    if (1 <= a <= 10**10) and (1 <= b <= 10**10):
        print(a+b)
        print(a-b)
        print(a*b)
    else:
        print('Invalid input!')

```
